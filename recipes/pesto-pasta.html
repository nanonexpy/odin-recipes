    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pesto is one of the most popular pasta toppings in Italy. It originated in Liguria, specifically in Genoa. This flavorful sauce is made of basil, extra-virgin olive oil, parmesan cheese, pecorino cheese, pine nuts, garlic and salt, traditionally ground in a ceramic or marble mortar. It can be homemade or commercially prepared. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons pesto</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat.</li>
    </ol>
