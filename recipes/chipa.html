    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chipas are cheese and anise seeds breads that are often sold in baskets on the roadside in Paraguay. These small, savory breads are sold by the bagful for under a dollar by street vendors known as chiperas. Chiperas have helped to transform the chipa into an identifying symbol of Paraguay throughout Latin America.</p>
    <p>The primary ingredient of chipa is manioc flour, ground from a tuber that is also known as mandioca, yuca, cassava, and tapioca root. Those chipas are similar to Colombian pan de queso, or Brazilian pao de queijo, the famous cheese bread from the state of Minas Gerais. With the same cassava flour, you can also make Brazilian breadsticks called biscoito de polvilho or our feroce d’avocat from the French West Indies.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ lb cassava flour</li>
        <li>⅔ lb cassava flour</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>½ lb Paraguayan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon anise seeds</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 420 F (220˚C).</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter and the eggs. Mix for a couple minutes. Incorporate the grated cheese and anise seeds.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the salt in the milk. Add to the mixture. Then, add the cassava flour and corn flour and continue mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into quarters, then divide each quarter into 4 equal sized balls. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll each ball into a rope of about 6 inches (15 cm) long and ½ inch (1 cm) thick. Bring ends together to form a circle and press to seal. Place 3 inches (8cm) apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake chipas for 20 to 25 minutes until slightly golden.</li>
